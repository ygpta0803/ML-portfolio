# Machine Learning Projects Repository

## Overview

This repository contains my implementations and analyses of machine learning concepts, inspired by the **'Create Machine Learning Models' learning path on Microsoft Learn**. While the modules provide structured lessons using tools like **scikit-learn, TensorFlow, and PyTorch**, I have extended the exercises by exploring additional datasets, conducting extra **hyperparameter tuning**, and providing in-depth **analysis and insights**.

Each chapter in this repository contains a practical challenge representing a key concept in machine learning, where I have gone beyond the provided material to further develop my understanding.
